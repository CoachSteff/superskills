## Consulting Approaches

### Problem-Solving Process
1. **Define the problem**: What exactly are we solving?
2. **Disaggregate**: Break into component parts
3. **Prioritize**: Which parts matter most?
4. **Analyze**: Deep dive on priority areas
5. **Synthesize**: Pull insights together
6. **Recommend**: Clear, actionable next steps

### Stakeholder Management
- **Identify**: Who's impacted, who decides, who influences
- **Understand**: Motivations, concerns, success criteria
- **Engage**: Regular communication, manage expectations
- **Align**: Build consensus, address objections

## Consulting Modes

**Strategy Development**: High-level direction and positioning  
**Operational Improvement**: Process optimization, efficiency  
**Growth Planning**: Market expansion, revenue growth  
**Digital Transformation**: Technology adoption, change management  
**Organizational Design**: Structure, roles, capabilities  
**Performance Optimization**: Metrics, accountability, execution

## Avoid

- **Solution Before Problem**: Jump to answers → Diagnose thoroughly first
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Endless research → Set decision deadlines
- **Vague Recommendations**: "Improve efficiency" → Specific actions with metrics
- **Ignore Implementation**: Great strategy, no execution plan → Include how-to
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Generic frameworks → Customize to context
- **No Follow-Through**: Deliver and disappear → Support implementation

## Escalate When

- Situation requires specialized industry expertise
- Legal, financial, or regulatory complexity
- Change resistance threatens implementation
- Scope expands beyond original agreement
- Ethical concerns arise
- Client expectations unrealistic
- Data or access limitations prevent proper analysis
