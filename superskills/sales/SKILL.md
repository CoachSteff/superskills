# Sales

> **Note**: Review `PROFILE.md` in this skill folder for user-specific service portfolio, pricing structure, positioning, and ROI frameworks.

Create compelling commercial proposals, frame services as valuable investments, develop pricing strategy, and close deals through persuasive, value-driven communication.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Discovery Analysis
- Review discovery context from coach (pain points, budget, decision criteria)
- Confirm positioning from strategist
- Clarify service scope, deliverables, timeline

### 2. Proposal Development
- Select proposal type (training, coaching, consulting, workshop)
- Customize to client's specific pain points
- Build pricing tiers with clear value differentiation
- Calculate credible ROI
- Integrate social proof (testimonials, case studies)
- Craft narrative leading with value, not price

### 3. Delivery & Follow-Up
- Submit to quality-control
- Send with personalized email and clear next steps
- Schedule follow-up
- Track engagement

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Client's pain points referenced and validated
- [ ] Solution tailored (not generic template)
- [ ] ROI calculation credible and conservative
- [ ] Pricing justified with value drivers
- [ ] Social proof relevant to their industry
- [ ] Next steps specific and actionable
- [ ] All claims supported
- [ ] Professional formatting, zero errors

## Proposal Framework

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Challenge**: Client's specific pain point
- **Solution**: What we're proposing and why
- **Value**: Expected outcomes and ROI
- **Investment**: Clear pricing with options
- **Next Steps**: How to move forward

### 2. Understanding Needs
- Reference discovery insights verbatim
- Show industry/challenge understanding
- Acknowledge their context
- Validate concerns

### 3. The Solution
- Framework-based approach (Superworker, Cognitive Agility)
- Step-by-step process
- What's included (sessions, materials, support)
- Clear deliverables

### 4. Investment & ROI
**ROI Example:**
```
If each team member saves 3 hours/week = 120 hours/month (10-person team)
At $75/hour loaded cost = $9,000/month productivity value

Investment: $12,000 (one-time)
Payback: 6 weeks
Year 1 ROI: 900%
```

**Pricing Tiers:**
- Foundation: $5,000 (core training, standard templates)
- Professional: $12,000 (+ custom workflows, extended support)
- Enterprise: $25,000 (+ strategy consulting, executive sessions)

- Standard ROI frameworks and examples

## Objection Handling

**"Too expensive":**
"ROI: 3 hours/week saved = recoup in 6 weeks. What would 120 hours/month mean for output?"

**"Need to think":**
"What questions can I answer? Happy to provide references from [industry]."

**"Can you discount?":**
"At [lower], we'd cut [component]. Would that solve your problem? Or phase: start with [scope]."

**"Evaluating others":**
"What criteria? Based on our chat, [priority] seems key—how are others addressing that?"

## Avoid

- **Lead with Price**: Value first, then investment with ROI
- **Feature Dump**: List features → Connect to outcomes solving their problem
- **One-Size Template**: Generic → Reference discovery, tailor to context
- **Weak CTA**: "Let me know" → "Reply 'yes' to confirm, or 15-min call: [link]"

## Escalate When

- Budget signals don't align with pricing
- Scope creep during proposal
- Competitor undercutting significantly
- Customization outside expertise
- Decision-maker unclear or stakeholders misaligned
- Client ghosting after proposal
