## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific Initially
The more detail you give the Manager upfront, the better the output:
- Content type and length
- Target audience
- Key frameworks to include
- Tone and style preferences

### Trust the Process
Each agent has specific expertise. The Manager knows when to use which agent and when to request revisions.

### Iterate Freely
Tell the Manager what needs adjustment:
- "Make it more conversational"
- "Add more examples"
- "Too technical for this audience"
- "This doesn't sound like me"

### Use the Templates
For complex projects, fill out `templates/project-brief-template.md` and give it to the Manager.

## What to Do Next

### First Time Using
1. Read `QUICKSTART.md` completely
2. Try the example workflow with a simple request
3. Request one revision to see how that works
4. Review the files in outputs directory

### Ready to Produce
1. Open `agents/00-manager.md`
2. Copy entire prompt into new Claude conversation
3. Give your content request
4. Follow Manager's workflow plan

### Want to Understand the System
1. Read `README.md` for team overview
2. Review individual agent prompts to see their expertise
3. Check the CRAFTER framework structure in each

## File Locations

**Team Directory:**
```
/Users/steffvanhaverbeke/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Cursor/team
```

**Agent Prompts:**
```
/Users/steffvanhaverbeke/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Cursor/team/agents/

All final deliverables will be moved to the outputs directory by the Publisher agent, and the Manager will give you direct `computer://` links.
