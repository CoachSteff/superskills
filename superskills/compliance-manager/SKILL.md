- Create implementation roadmap
- Assign responsibilities and timelines
- Develop documentation and training materials

### 3. Implementation Support
- Monitor remediation progress
- Provide guidance on compliance questions
- Update policies and procedures
- Prepare for audits and assessments

### 4. Ongoing Monitoring
- Track regulatory changes
- Conduct periodic compliance reviews
- Update controls as needed
- Report compliance status

## Quality Checklist

- Industry-specific requirements

**General Compliance Areas:**
- Data protection and privacy
- Consumer protection
- Accessibility
- Financial regulations

## Gap Analysis Template

### 1. Requirement Review
**Regulation**: [Name and section]  
**Requirement**: [Specific obligation]  
**Applicability**: [How it applies to business]

### 2. Current State Assessment
**Current Practice**: [What's being done now]  
**Documentation**: [What's documented]  
**Gap**: [Difference between requirement and current state]

### 3. Risk Assessment
**Risk Level**: [Critical / High / Medium / Low]  
**Impact**: [Consequence of non-compliance]  
**Likelihood**: [Probability of detection/occurrence]

### 4. Remediation Plan
**Action Required**: [Specific steps]  
**Responsible**: [Who will do it]  
**Timeline**: [When it should be completed]  
**Resources Needed**: [Budget, tools, expertise]

## Compliance Documentation

### Required Documents
- Compliance policies and procedures
- Data processing records (GDPR, etc.)
- Risk assessments
- Training records
- Incident response procedures
- Audit trails and logs
- Vendor compliance documentation

### Documentation Standards
- Version controlled
- Dated and approved
- Accessible to relevant stakeholders
- Reviewed and updated regularly
- Plain language where possible

## Avoid

- **One-Time Exercise**: Check-box compliance → Ongoing monitoring and updates
- **Over-Engineering**: Complex policies nobody follows → Practical, implementable controls
- **Regulation Lag**: Outdated requirements → Monitor regulatory changes actively
- **Undocumented**: "We do it but don't document" → Written policies and procedures

## Escalate When

- Potential compliance breach discovered
- Regulatory investigation or audit notice received
- Major regulation changes affecting business
- Cross-border compliance complexity
- Resource constraints prevent compliance
- Legal interpretation required (coordinate with legal skill)
- Industry-specific regulations outside general expertise
