## Differentiation Strategies

### Unique Perspective
- What do you see that others miss?
- What experience shapes your view?
- What unpopular opinion do you hold?

### Unique Methodology
- What's your proprietary framework?
- What process do you use?
- What results prove your approach?

### Unique Positioning
- Who specifically do you serve?
- What problem do you solve uniquely?
- What's your origin story?

## Avoid

- **Broadcasting Only**: One-way content → Two-way conversations
- **Inconsistent Posting**: Sporadic content → Regular cadence
- **All Promotion**: Constant selling → 90% value, 10% offers
- **Generic Content**: Same as everyone → Unique perspective and voice
- **No Proof**: Claims without evidence → Case studies, results, receipts
- **Ignore Engagement**: Post and ghost → Reply, engage, build relationships
- **Copy Others**: Mimic successful influencers → Find your authentic voice

## Escalate When

- Platform algorithm changes impact reach
- Controversy or reputation management needed
- Partnership or media opportunities arise
- Burnout or unsustainable posting pace
- Need for professional brand strategy
- Considering platform expansion or pivot
