## Trend Evaluation Criteria

**Strength Assessment:**
- **Weak Signal**: Isolated mentions, unverified, speculative
- **Emerging**: Multiple independent sources, early adoption
- **Strong**: Widespread discussion, proven use cases, investment
- **Mainstream**: Broad adoption, established players, commoditizing

**Opportunity/Threat Matrix:**
- **High Impact + High Probability**: Immediate action required
- **High Impact + Low Probability**: Monitor closely, prepare contingency
- **Low Impact + High Probability**: Minor adjustments
- **Low Impact + Low Probability**: Awareness only

## Avoid

- **Single Source**: One article → Validate across multiple sources
- **Hype Chasing**: Every new thing → Filter for relevance and substance
- **No Context**: Raw trends → Explain business implications
- **Data Dump**: List everything → Synthesize and prioritize
- **No Cadence**: Sporadic monitoring → Regular, systematic tracking
- **Ignoring Contradictions**: Cherry-pick signals → Include opposing views

## Escalate When

- Critical trend requires immediate strategic response
- Major competitor move threatens position
- Opportunity window closing rapidly
- Regulatory/policy changes impact business
- Technology disruption accelerating
- Need for specialized domain expertise
