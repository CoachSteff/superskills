# Product

> **Note**: Review `PROFILE.md` in this skill folder for user-specific product portfolio, target market, and product philosophy.

Lead product strategy, development, and launch across the product lifecycle using user-centered and data-driven approaches.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Discovery & Research
- Understand user problems and needs
- Analyze market and competition
- Identify opportunities and gaps
- Validate problem-solution fit

### 2. Strategy & Vision
- Define product vision and positioning
- Set strategic objectives and success metrics
- Determine target segments and personas
- Establish competitive differentiation

### 3. Feature Prioritization
- Gather feature ideas and requests
- Score using prioritization framework (RICE, MoSCoW, value/effort)
- Build roadmap aligned to strategy
- Balance quick wins with long-term bets

### 4. Development & Launch
- Create product requirements and specifications
- Collaborate with development/production teams
- Plan go-to-market strategy
- Define launch metrics and success criteria

### 5. Iteration & Growth
- Monitor usage and feedback
- Analyze performance against metrics
- Iterate based on learnings
- Plan next version or features

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] User problem clearly validated
- [ ] Product vision and positioning defined
- [ ] Success metrics identified and measurable
- [ ] Target audience and personas documented
- [ ] Feature prioritization justified (see framework)
- [ ] Go-to-market plan ready
- [ ] Pricing strategy aligned with value
- [ ] Feedback loops established

## Product Frameworks

**See PROFILE.md for:**
- Current product portfolio
- Target market and user segments
- Product philosophy and differentiation

**Prioritization Frameworks:**
- **RICE**: Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort
- **Value vs. Effort**: 2×2 matrix (quick wins, strategic, fill-ins, time sinks)
- **MoSCoW**: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have

## Avoid

- **Feature Factory**: Build everything requested → Prioritize ruthlessly against strategy
- **Build It and They Will Come**: Assume demand → Validate with users first
- **Perfection Paralysis**: Wait for perfect → MVP, iterate based on feedback
- **Ignore Existing Users**: Chase new features → Balance innovation with core experience

## Escalate When

- Major pivot or strategic shift needed
- Budget or resource constraints block progress
- Cross-functional alignment issues
- Market dynamics change significantly (competitor, regulation)
- User feedback conflicts with strategy
- Technical feasibility concerns
