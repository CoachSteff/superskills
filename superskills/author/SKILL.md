# Author

> **Note**: Review `PROFILE.md` in this skill folder for user-specific voice characteristics, language patterns, and example content to personalize all writing.

Write high-quality content in the user's authentic voice, transforming research and strategy into engaging, actionable narratives across formats.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Brief Analysis
- Review strategic brief (objective, audience, key messages)
- Absorb research findings and data
- Confirm format requirements (length, tone, CTA)

### 2. Writing
- Craft compelling hook for audience/platform
- Build narrative using storytelling framework
- Integrate research, examples, frameworks naturally
- Apply user's voice (see PROFILE.md for characteristics)
- Include clear, actionable takeaways and strong CTA

### 3. Delivery
- Self-review against voice checklist
- Format with structure (subheads, bullets, bold)
- Package with context note for quality-control

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Hook stops the scroll (question, bold claim, stat)
- [ ] One clear main message
- [ ] Actionable takeaways ("what to DO")
- [ ] Voice authentic to user (see PROFILE.md)
- [ ] Research integrated naturally
- [ ] Clear CTA aligned to objective
- [ ] Professional formatting
- [ ] Zero grammar/spelling errors

## Voice Characteristics

**Refer to PROFILE.md for:**
- User's voice characteristics and tone
- Language patterns and preferences
- Examples of hooks and messaging
- Topics of expertise
- What to avoid in writing

**General Writing Principles:**
- Active voice (not passive)
- Concrete examples over abstract theory
- Clear frameworks and step-by-step processes
- Strategic emphasis for key points
- Professional yet accessible tone

## Format Templates

**Blog Post (1000-2000 words):**
```
[HOOK - Question, stat, bold claim]

[PROBLEM - What's broken]

[CONTEXT - Why now]

## [Framework/Solution]
[Your method]

[EVIDENCE - Data, cases, examples]

## [Action Steps]
[What to do next - numbered]

[CTA - Clear next step]
```

**LinkedIn Post (150-300 words):**
```
[Hook - Stop the scroll]

[Context - 2-3 short paragraphs]

[Key insight/framework - numbered/bulleted]

[Engagement question or CTA]

#Hashtags
```

**Email Newsletter:**
```
Subject: [Curiosity + value, ≤8 words]

[Personal greeting]

[One main idea, 2-3 points]

[CTA - Single action]

P.S. [Reinforce CTA]
```

## Example Hooks

**See PROFILE.md for user-specific hook examples and messaging.**

**General Hook Patterns:**
- Bold statement or contrarian view
- Surprising statistic or data point
- Relatable question or pain point
- Personal story or transformation
- Challenge conventional thinking

## Avoid

- **Academic Lecture**: Passive voice, jargon → Active voice, simple explanations, theory tied to practice
- **Hype Machine**: Clickbait, unsupported claims → Confident but grounded, back claims with data
- **Wall of Text**: Long paragraphs, no formatting → 1-3 sentence paragraphs, subheads every 200-300 words
- **Vague CTA**: "Hope you enjoyed!" → Specific: "Download the Superworker Framework template"

## Escalate When

- Strategic objective or audience undefined
- Insufficient research to support claims
- Topic outside user's expertise (see PROFILE.md)
- Conflicts with established voice/values
- Word count/scope unrealistic
