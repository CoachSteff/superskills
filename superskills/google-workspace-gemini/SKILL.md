## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Effective Prompt Structure
```
[Task] + [Context] + [Style/Format] + [Constraints]

Example:
"Write a project proposal for implementing AI tools in our 
marketing department. Include sections on goals, timeline, 
budget, and expected ROI. Use professional but accessible 
language. Keep it to 2 pages."
```

### The 5 W's for Better Prompts
- **What**: Specific task or output needed
- **Who**: Audience or perspective
- **Where**: Context or location
- **When**: Timeframe or urgency
- **Why**: Purpose or goal

### Prompt Templates by App

**Gmail - Email Composition:**
```
"Draft an email to [recipient] about [topic]. 
Tone: [professional/casual/formal]. 
Include: [key points]. 
Length: [brief/detailed]."
```

**Docs - Content Creation:**
```
"Create a [document type] about [topic] for [audience].

## Productivity Measurement

### Metrics to Track

- **Quality**: Error rate, revision cycles
- **Adoption**: % of team using Gemini regularly
- **Satisfaction**: User feedback scores

### Measurement Methods
- **Time logs**: Before/after for common tasks
- **Self-reporting**: Weekly surveys
- **Usage analytics**: Workspace admin console
- **Output tracking**: Count deliverables
- **Quality checks**: Peer review scores

### ROI Calculation
```
COST:
- Gemini for Workspace: $30/user/month
- Training/setup: One-time investment
TOTAL: $360/user/year + setup

BENEFIT:
- Time saved: [hours/week × 50 weeks × hourly rate]
- Quality improvement: [value of fewer errors]
- Increased output: [additional deliverables × value]
TOTAL: $[benefit per user per year]

ROI: ([Benefit - Cost] / Cost) × 100
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Iterative Prompting
Start broad, refine with follow-ups:
1. Initial prompt: General request
2. Review output, identify gaps
3. Follow-up: "Add more detail on..."
4. Follow-up: "Change tone to..."
5. Final: "Format as..."

### Context Stacking
Build on previous interactions:
- "Using the outline we just created..."
- "Based on the analysis above..."
- "Following the same format..."

### Constraint Optimization
Be specific about limits:
- Word/page count
- Tone and style
- Required sections
- Data sources to use
- Format requirements

## Avoid

- **Vague Prompts**: "Write something" → Specific task with details
- **One-Shot Only**: Single prompt → Iterate and refine
- **No Review**: Trust blindly → Always verify and edit
- **Ignore Context**: Generic prompts → Include relevant background
- **Over-Reliance**: Let AI do everything → Use as augmentation
- **No Documentation**: Lose good prompts → Build prompt library

## Escalate When

- Data privacy or compliance concerns
- Need for custom integration (Apps Script)
- Enterprise deployment questions
- Technical issues with Gemini access
- Comparison with other tools needed
- ROI not meeting expectations
- Training needs beyond individual use
