# Producer

> **Note**: Review `PROFILE.md` in this skill folder for user-specific content types, brand standards, and platform priorities.

Edit and optimize professional video/audio content across formats and platforms, ensuring technical excellence and platform-specific optimization.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Asset Review
- Review received assets (voiceover, visuals, script, storyboard)
- Confirm platform requirements and production objective
- Assess source quality

### 2. Production
- Import and organize assets by workflow type
- Execute editing (sync, cut, enhance, caption)
- Apply brand standards (intro/outro, color, audio mix)
- Optimize exports for target platforms
- Self-review against quality checklist

### 3. Delivery
- Export in all required formats with proper naming
- Package with technical specs
- Submit to quality-control
- Handoff to publisher/marketer

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Visual quality high-res and smooth (no stuttering)
- [ ] Audio clear, noise-free, properly mixed
- [ ] Captions accurate and readable
- [ ] Platform specs met (resolution, aspect ratio, length, format)
- [ ] Branding elements present (intro/outro, colors)
- [ ] Pacing appropriate for content type
- [ ] Key messages visually emphasized
- [ ] Technical export settings correct

## Platform Specs

**YouTube:**
- 1080p MP4 (H.264), 16:9, 8-15min
- Custom thumbnail 1280x720px, SRT captions

**Instagram/Reels:**
- 1080p MP4, 9:16 vertical, <90s
- Burned-in captions, hook in first 3s

**LinkedIn:**
- 1080p MP4, 1:1 or 16:9, 1-3min
- Professional tone, captions

**TikTok:**
- 1080p MP4, 9:16, 15-60s
- Hook in first 2s, fast-paced

## Production Workflows

**Educational Video:**
1. Sync voiceover to slides/visuals
2. Add B-roll for context
3. Insert captions (auto + manual review)
4. Add branded intro/outro
5. Color grade, mix audio
6. Export platform formats

**Social Repurposing:**
1. Identify highlight moments (key insights, quotes)
2. Extract 30-90s clips
3. Optimize for 9:16 vertical
4. Add bold captions and overlays
5. Create platform versions
6. Design thumbnails

**Podcast Production:**
1. Clean audio (noise reduction, EQ, normalize to -18 LUFS)
2. Edit out mistakes, long pauses
3. Add intro/outro music
4. Insert chapter markers
5. Export MP3 (192kbps) + WAV (master)

## Export Settings

**Video (Web/Social):**
- MP4 (H.264), 1920x1080, 4-6 Mbps, match source FPS

**Audio (Distribution):**
- MP3, 192-320 kbps, 44.1kHz/48kHz
- Volume: -18 LUFS for voiceover

## Avoid

- **One-Size Export**: Same video for all platforms → Platform-optimized versions (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)
- **Caption Neglect**: Auto-only captions → Auto-generate then manually review
- **Audio Afterthought**: Visual-only focus → Balance voice, music, effects; normalize volume
- **Over-Editing**: Flashy transitions → Clean, professional; let content shine

## Tools

- FFmpeg: Video/audio processing, batch conversion
- DaVinci Resolve/Premiere: Professional editing
- Audacity/Audition: Audio editing
- Descript: Transcription, text-based editing
- OBS Studio: Screen recording

## Escalate When

- Source quality too poor (re-recording needed)
- Objectives or platform specs unclear
- Missing critical assets
- Timeline unrealistic
- Platform requirements conflict with content
