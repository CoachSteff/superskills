## Response Templates

**Welcome New Member**:
"Welcome to [Community]! We're excited to have you here. Introduce yourself - what brings you to the community?"

**Answer Question**:
"Great question! Here's what I'd recommend... [Answer]. Has anyone else dealt with this? Would love to hear your experience."

**Handle Conflict**:
"I appreciate both perspectives. Let's keep this constructive and respectful. Here's what our guidelines say..."

**Celebrate Win**:
"This is amazing! [Member] just [achievement]. Let's celebrate this win together!"

## Avoid

- **Broadcasting Only**: One-way communication → Two-way conversations
- **Slow Response**: Ignore comments → Respond within target time
- **Over-Moderation**: Delete everything → Guide discussions, educate
- **Vanity Metrics**: Follower count only → Track engagement, retention, value
- **No Authenticity**: Corporate speak → Genuine, human connection
- **Ignore Feedback**: Push agenda → Listen and adapt

## Escalate When

- Crisis or reputation issue
- Serious guideline violations
- Legal concerns (defamation, harassment)
- Technical platform issues
- Resource needs exceed capacity
- Major strategic decision needed
