# ==============================================================================

# ==============================================================================
# COLOR PALETTE
# ==============================================================================
# Based on your brand's visual aesthetic and presentation style
# Design Principle: Dark theme with bright blue highlights and strategic accents
# Contrast Ratio: WCAG AA compliant (white on dark = 15:1)

colors:
  # PRIMARY COLOR: Blue - Signature brand color
  # USE FOR: Main headings, brand emphasis, key terms, framework names
  # AVOID: Body text (use 'text'), large backgrounds (too bright)
  # RATIONALE: Immediately recognizable brand color
  # CONTRAST: 8:1 ratio with dark background (excellent readability)
  primary: "#2563eb"
  
  # SECONDARY COLOR: Dark charcoal - Default slide background
  # USE FOR: Slide backgrounds (dark theme default)
  # CREATES: High contrast foundation for white text
  # PROFESSIONAL: Corporate-friendly, reduces eye strain
  secondary: "#1f2937"
  
  # ACCENT COLOR: Red - Emphasis and warnings
  # USE FOR: Warning symbols, "no" icons, critical points, errors
  # FREQUENCY: Sparingly, 1-2 elements per slide maximum
  # CONTEXT: Negative concepts, things to avoid, danger signals
  # EXAMPLE: "❌ Too many bullets (>6 per slide)"
  accent: "#ef4444"
  
  # ACCENT SECONDARY: Yellow/Gold - Highlights and questions
  # USE FOR: Questions, important highlights, attention-grabbing moments
  # FREQUENCY: Alternate with red/green for visual variety
  # CONTEXT: Engagement, curiosity, exploration, "aha" moments
  # EXAMPLE: Question headings, "💡" lightbulb concepts
  accent_secondary: "#eab308"
  
  # ACCENT TERTIARY: Green - Positive elements
  # USE FOR: Checkmarks, success indicators, positive outcomes, growth
  # FREQUENCY: Reserve for clearly positive concepts only
  # CONTEXT: Achievements, correct practices, progress
  # EXAMPLE: "✅ Heading clarity: understandable in 2 seconds"
  accent_tertiary: "#10b981"
  
  # BACKGROUND: Default dark theme (same as secondary)
  # MATCHES: Your brand's presentation style
  # AI RULE: Use this unless user explicitly requests light theme
  background: "#1f2937"
  
  # BACKGROUND LIGHT: Alternative light theme (rarely used)
  # USE WHEN: User explicitly requests "theme: light" in input
  # ADJUST: Text colors automatically swap (use text_dark for headings)
  # NOTE: Blue (#2563eb) still works on white (8:1 contrast)
  background_light: "#ffffff"
  
  # TEXT PRIMARY: White - Main body text
  # USE FOR: All body text, bullets, captions on dark backgrounds
  # CONTRAST: WCAG AA+ compliant with #1f2937 background (15:1 ratio)
  # READABILITY: Maximum contrast, optimal for 1920x1080 resolution
  text: "#ffffff"
  
  # TEXT DARK: For light backgrounds (inverse of text)
  # USE WHEN: theme="light" or light background slides
  # MAINTAINS: Same contrast ratio (15:1) on white background
  text_dark: "#1f2937"
  
  # TEXT SECONDARY: Gray - Supporting/de-emphasized text
  # USE FOR: Captions, metadata, less important text, image captions
  # READABILITY: Sufficient contrast (7:1) but visually de-emphasized
  # PURPOSE: Creates hierarchy without bold/size changes
  text_secondary: "#9ca3af"

# ==============================================================================
# TYPOGRAPHY
# ==============================================================================
# System fonts for maximum compatibility and professional appearance
# Font Loading: No external fonts = faster rendering, no CORS issues
# Hierarchy: Bold headings (700), regular body (400), script signature (400)

fonts:
  heading:
    # SYSTEM UI STACK: Native system fonts for crisp rendering
    # FALLBACKS: macOS → Windows → Linux font preferences
    # WEIGHT 700: Bold for headings = immediate visual hierarchy
    # USE FOR: Slide headings, section titles, framework names
    # RATIONALE: Professional appearance, consistent across platforms
    family: "system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif"
    weight: 700
    
  body:
    # SAME FAMILY: Consistency with headings, different weight creates hierarchy
    # WEIGHT 400: Regular for body text = optimal readability
    # USE FOR: Bullets, captions, body text, all non-heading text
    # RATIONALE: Clean, readable, matches heading font family
    family: "system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif"
    weight: 400
    
  signature:
    # CURSIVE STACK: Handwritten/script style for personal branding
    # FALLBACKS: Multiple cursive fonts for cross-platform compatibility
    # USE FOR: Logo text fallback ONLY (when logo.file is null)
    # RATIONALE: Handwritten style adds personal touch, signature aesthetic
    # NOTE: Not used for slide content, only logo watermark
    family: "'Brush Script MT', 'Dancing Script', 'Pacifico', cursive"
    weight: 400

# ==============================================================================
# LAYOUT & SPACING
# ==============================================================================
# Based on 1920x1080 Full HD standard (most common video resolution)
# Generous padding ensures content doesn't touch edges (professional appearance)
# All measurements in pixels for predictable, consistent rendering

layout:
  # SLIDE DIMENSIONS: Standard Full HD video format
  # 1920x1080 = 16:9 aspect ratio (universal video standard)
  # AI AGENTS: Never change these values (fixed output resolution)
  slide_width: 1920
  slide_height: 1080
  
  # PADDING: Distance from slide edges to content boundaries
  # 80px = 4.2% of slide width (generous whitespace)
  # PURPOSE: Professional appearance, content doesn't touch edges
  # AI AGENTS: Ensure all text/images respect this boundary
  # RATIONALE: Prevents cropping issues, creates breathing room
  padding: 80
  
  # TITLE SIZE: For title slide headings (Level 1 hierarchy)
  # 72px = Large enough for immediate impact at 1920x1080
  # USE ON: First slide, major section dividers, closing slide
  # VISIBILITY: Readable from 10+ feet away (presentation context)
  # RATIONALE: Establishes strong visual hierarchy, grabs attention
  title_size: 72
  
  # HEADING SIZE: For content slide headings (Level 2 hierarchy)
  # 48px = Clear hierarchy below title, still prominent
  # USE ON: Content slides, framework names, section headings
  # READABILITY: Scannable at glance (2-second comprehension)
  # RATIONALE: Balances prominence with content space
  heading_size: 48
  
  # BODY SIZE: For bullets, captions, body text (Level 3 hierarchy)
  # 32px = Ensures readability at 1920x1080 resolution
  # USE FOR: All bullet points, captions, body text
  # MINIMUM: Never go below 32px for body text (readability threshold)
  # RATIONALE: Readable from typical viewing distance (3-6 feet)
  body_size: 32
  
  # BULLET SPACING: Line height multiplier for bullet lists
  # 0.8em = 80% of font size added as space between lines
  # EXAMPLE: 32px font + 25.6px spacing = comfortable reading
  # PURPOSE: Breathing room between bullets, prevents cramped appearance
  # AI AGENTS: Apply to all bullet lists for visual consistency
  bullet_spacing: "0.8em"

# ==============================================================================
# LOGO CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
# Supports both image files (SVG/PNG preferred) and text fallback
# Position-aware system: 4 corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
# Resolution: Intelligent path resolution (relative from brand/ or absolute)

logo:
  enabled: true
  
  # IMAGE LOGO: Path to logo file (preferred branding method)
  # RELATIVE PATH: From brand/ directory (e.g., "assets/logo.svg")
  # ABSOLUTE PATH: Full system path also supported (/Users/kessa/logo.png)
  # SUPPORTED FORMATS: .svg (scalable, preferred), .png, .jpg, .webp
  # SET TO null: To use text fallback instead (see 'text' field below)
  # AI AGENTS: Check file exists before rendering, fallback gracefully
  file: "assets/logo.svg"
  
  # TEXT FALLBACK: Used when file is null or not found
  # RENDERS: In signature cursive font (handwritten style)
  # PLACEMENT: Same position as image logo (bottom-right default)
  # USE CASE: When logo file unavailable or text watermark preferred
  # FONT: Uses fonts.signature family (Brush Script MT, etc.)
  text: "[Your Brand Name]"
  
  # POSITION: Logo placement on slide (4 corner options)
  # OPTIONS: "top-left", "top-right", "bottom-left", "bottom-right"
  # RECOMMENDATION: bottom-right (doesn't obstruct slide content)
  # AI AGENTS: Respect user's position if specified, else use default
  # RATIONALE: Bottom-right is least intrusive, industry standard
  position: "bottom-right"
  
  # WIDTH: Logo width in pixels (height auto-scales to maintain aspect ratio)
  # 200px = Visible but not dominant (10.4% of slide width)
  # RANGE: 150-250px recommended (smaller = subtle, larger = prominent)
  # AI AGENTS: Adjust if user provides custom width, maintain aspect ratio
  # RATIONALE: Balance between visibility and content space
  width: 200
  
  # SIZE: Font size for text fallback logo (when file is null)
  # 36px = Matches signature font aesthetic, subtle branding
  # USE WITH: fonts.signature family (cursive/handwritten style)
  # VISIBILITY: Readable but not distracting (watermark effect)
  size: 36
  
  # COLOR: Text color for fallback logo (when using text instead of file)
  # White (#ffffff) ensures visibility on dark backgrounds
  # CONTRAST: Matches body text color for consistency
  # AI AGENTS: Automatically adjust if user specifies light theme
  color: "#ffffff"
  
  # OPACITY: Transparency level (0.0 = invisible, 1.0 = fully opaque)
  # 0.9 = Subtle transparency (professional watermark appearance)
  # EFFECT: Visible but doesn't compete with main content
  # RATIONALE: Branding present without overwhelming slide content
  opacity: 0.9
  
  # PADDING: Distance from slide edges (overrides layout.padding for logo)
  # 40px = Half of content padding (logo can be closer to edges)
  # PURPOSE: Subtle corner placement without touching edge
  # COORDINATES: bottom-right = (1920-40-width, 1080-40-height)
  padding: 40

# ==============================================================================
# THEME CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
# Global theme setting affects background and text colors throughout presentation
# Two options: "dark" (default) or "light" (rare, user-requested only)

# DEFAULT THEME: "dark" (brand standard)
# MATCHES: Professional brand aesthetic and presentation style
# COLORS: Dark charcoal background (#1f2937) + white text (#ffffff)
# RATIONALE: Professional, reduces eye strain, emphasizes content
#
# ALTERNATIVE: "light" (use background_light + text_dark colors)
# USE WHEN: User explicitly requests "theme: light" in input JSON
# COLORS: White background (#ffffff) + dark text (#1f2937)
# NOTE: Blue (#2563eb) headings work on both themes
#
# AI AGENTS: Always default to "dark" unless user specifies otherwise
theme: "dark"

# ==============================================================================
# ICON STYLE (Future Enhancement)
# ==============================================================================
# Guidelines for icon-based slides (when icon feature implemented)
# Current Status: Defined for future use, not yet in templates

icons:
  # STYLE: Minimalist line art matching professional aesthetic
  # EXAMPLES: Shield (security), brain (AI), gear (process), heart (empathy)
  # LIBRARY: plant, rocket, stairs, handshake, puzzle, scale, chip
  # COMPLEXITY: Simple geometric shapes, recognizable at 32px size
  style: "minimalist line art"
  
  # COLOR: White to match body text (#ffffff)
  # MAINTAINS: Visual consistency with text elements
  # CONTRAST: Clear visibility on dark background
  color: "#ffffff"
  
  # STROKE WIDTH: Line thickness for icon strokes
  # 2px = Matches body text weight (400), clear but not heavy
  # VISIBILITY: Recognizable at 32px square size
  stroke_width: 2
