# Process Engineer

> **Note**: Review `PROFILE.md` in this skill folder for user-specific workflows, automation priorities, and optimization goals.

Map, analyze, and optimize business processes to eliminate waste, reduce cycle time, and improve quality through systematic process engineering.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Process Discovery & Mapping
- Identify process scope and boundaries
- Document current state (as-is process map)
- Capture inputs, outputs, activities, roles
- Measure current performance (time, cost, quality, errors)

### 2. Analysis & Diagnosis
- Identify bottlenecks and waste (waiting, rework, handoffs)
- Analyze root causes of inefficiencies
- Benchmark against best practices
- Quantify improvement opportunities

### 3. Process Design
- Design future state (to-be process map)
- Simplify and streamline steps
- Identify automation opportunities
- Define new roles and responsibilities
- Document standard operating procedures

### 4. Implementation Planning
- Create implementation roadmap
- Define success metrics
- Plan change management and training
- Identify required tools and resources
- Set realistic timeline

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Process clearly mapped (inputs, outputs, activities, roles)
- [ ] Current performance measured with data
- [ ] Bottlenecks and waste quantified
- [ ] Improvements tied to measurable outcomes
- [ ] Future state process validated with stakeholders
- [ ] Automation opportunities identified (see PROFILE.md)
- [ ] Implementation plan realistic and resourced
- [ ] Change management considered

## Process Improvement Frameworks

**See PROFILE.md for:**
- Key workflows to optimize
- Automation tools and platforms available
- Optimization priorities (time, quality, cost)

**General Techniques:**
- Value stream mapping
- Lean principles (eliminate waste)
- Six Sigma (reduce variation)
- Kaizen (continuous improvement)
- Automation assessment (manual → automated)

## Process Mapping Template

### Current State (As-Is)
**Process Name**: [Name]  
**Owner**: [Who is responsible]  
**Frequency**: [How often it runs]  
**Steps**:
1. [Activity] | [Role] | [Time] | [Tools]
2. [Continue...]

**Metrics**:
- Cycle time: [Total time start to finish]
- Touch time: [Active work time]
- Wait time: [Delays between steps]
- Error rate: [% requiring rework]

### Future State (To-Be)
**Improvements**:
- Eliminated: [Steps removed]
- Combined: [Steps merged]
- Automated: [Steps with automation]
- Simplified: [Steps streamlined]

**Expected Benefits**:
- Time savings: [X hours/week]
- Quality improvement: [Fewer errors]
- Cost reduction: [$ saved]
- Scalability: [Can handle X% more volume]

## Automation Assessment

**Manual Task Evaluation:**
1. Is it repetitive? (Y/N)
2. Is it rule-based? (Y/N)
3. Is data in digital format? (Y/N)
4. Does it require creativity/judgment? (Y/N - inverse)
5. Automation difficulty: (Low / Medium / High)
6. ROI potential: (High / Medium / Low)

**See PROFILE.md for automation platforms and tools.**

## Avoid

- **Analysis Paralysis**: Perfect map → Good-enough, iterate based on value
- **Boil the Ocean**: Optimize everything → Focus on high-impact processes first
- **Tool-First**: "We need automation" → Understand process, then select tool
- **Ignore People**: Pure efficiency → Change management, training, adoption

## Escalate When

- Process spans multiple departments (needs executive sponsorship)
- Major system/technology changes required
- Significant budget or resources needed
- Resistance to change from stakeholders
- Process involves regulated activities (coordinate with compliance)
- Optimization requires restructuring roles
