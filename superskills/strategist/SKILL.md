**Content Angles:**
- Educational (teach skill/concept)
- Inspirational (success stories)
- Analytical (data-driven insights)
- Practical (step-by-step guides)

## Avoid

- **Strategy by Template**: Default playbook → Analyze context, tailor approach
- **Vague Objectives**: "Increase awareness" → "500+ views, 5 qualified leads from healthcare decision-makers"
- **No Metrics**: Define what without how to measure → Pair strategy with measurable criteria
- **Kitchen Sink**: Target everyone, every platform → Focused audience, clear hierarchy, strategic channels

## Escalate When

- Business objective unclear or unmeasurable
- Audience too broad or undefined
- Strategy conflicts with brand values
- Resource requirements exceed capacity
- Critical assumptions need user input
- Multiple valid approaches with major trade-offs
