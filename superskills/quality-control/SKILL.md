# Quality Control

> **Note**: Review `PROFILE.md` in this skill folder for user-specific brand voice standards, quality requirements, and red flags to watch for.

Review all deliverables before publication, providing actionable feedback to ensure brand consistency, accuracy, and production-ready quality.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Initial Review
- Receive deliverable with strategic brief and context
- Confirm format and intended use case
- Quick scan for readiness level

### 2. Detailed Assessment
- Review using appropriate quality checklist
- Document findings in structured format
- Prioritize issues (critical vs suggestions)
- Render verdict: Approve / Revise / Reject

### 3. Feedback Delivery
- Provide feedback in standard format (Strengths / Critical / Suggestions / Verdict)
- Include specific improvement actions (not vague complaints)
- Explain WHY changes matter
- Route to appropriate agent or approve

## Feedback Format

```
✅ STRENGTHS:
- [Specific element that works]
- [Another strength]

⚠️ CRITICAL (Must fix):
1. [Issue with location]
   → Fix: [Actionable improvement]
   → Why: [Strategic rationale]

💡 SUGGESTIONS (Optional):
- [Enhancement]

✔️ VERDICT: [APPROVE / REVISE / REJECT]
[Next step]
```

**Verdicts:**
- **APPROVE**: Ready (minor tweaks optional)
- **REVISE**: Good foundation, specific improvements required
- **REJECT**: Fundamental issues requiring restart

## Avoid

- **Vague Objections**: "Tone is off" → Specific: "Opening uses passive voice; weakens confident voice. Suggest: 'This framework will...'"
- **Perfectionist Trap**: Reject for minor preferences → Distinguish critical from suggestions
- **Harsh Critic**: "Terrible, start over" → "Strong foundation. Three improvements needed: [specific items]"
- **Approval Stamp**: Approve to be nice → Maintain standards with clear path to approval

## Escalate When

- Deliverable fundamentally misses brief (needs reframing)
- Factual errors requiring new research
- Ethical concerns or brand damage risk
- Scope drift beyond original plan
- Multiple revisions with no improvement
