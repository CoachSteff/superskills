## Prompt Engineering Framework

### Effective Prompt Structure
```
[Role/Context] + [Task] + [Format] + [Constraints]

Example:
"You are a senior marketing analyst. Create a competitive analysis 
of our top 3 competitors based on the attached market research. 
Format as a table with columns for strengths, weaknesses, and 
market share. Keep it to 2 pages maximum."
```

### The 4 C's of Copilot Prompts
1. **Clear**: Specific and unambiguous instructions
2. **Contextual**: Provide relevant background and constraints
3. **Complete**: Include all necessary information
4. **Conversational**: Natural language, iterate if needed

### Prompt Templates by App

**Word - Document Creation:**
```
"Create a [document type] about [topic] for [audience]. 
Include sections on [key points]. Use a [tone] tone. 
Target length: [word count]."
```

**Excel - Data Analysis:**
```
"Analyze this data to [objective]. Create a [chart type] 
showing [specific insight]. Highlight [key metrics] and 
provide [3/5/10] actionable recommendations."
```

**PowerPoint - Presentation:**
```
"Create a [presentation type] about [topic] for [audience]. 
Include [number] slides covering [key points]. Use [visual style]. 
Generate speaker notes for each slide."
```

**Outlook - Email Composition:**
```
"Draft an email to [recipient] about [topic]. Tone should be 
[formal/casual/urgent]. Key points to include: [list]. 
Keep it [brief/detailed]."
```

**Teams - Meeting Summary:**
```
"Summarize this meeting focusing on [aspect]. Include: 
decisions made, action items with owners, open questions, 
and next steps. Format as bullet points."
```

## Adoption Best Practices

### Change Management
- **Communicate value**: Show real examples, not theory
- **Start with champions**: Identify early adopters
- **Celebrate wins**: Share success stories
- **Address concerns**: Privacy, job security, learning curve
- **Provide support**: Help desk, FAQ, community

### Rollout Strategy
1. **Pilot**: Select 20-50 users, diverse roles
2. **Feedback**: Gather insights, iterate training
3. **Expand**: Department by department
4. **Scale**: Organization-wide with support
5. **Optimize**: Continuous improvement

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: % of users actively using Copilot
- **Engagement**: Prompts per user per week
- **Satisfaction**: User survey scores
- **Productivity**: Time saved (self-reported + measured)
- **Quality**: Error reduction, output improvement
- **ROI**: Cost savings vs. investment

## ROI Calculation Framework

```
INVESTMENT:
- Copilot licenses: $30/user/month × [users] × 12 months
- Training development: [hours × rate]
- Training delivery: [hours × rate]
- Support & change management: [hours × rate]
TOTAL INVESTMENT: $[X]

BENEFITS (Annual):
- Time saved: [hours/week × users × 50 weeks × hourly rate]
- Quality improvements: [error reduction × cost per error]
- Revenue impact: [faster execution × value]
TOTAL BENEFIT: $[Y]

ROI: ([Y - X] / X) × 100 = [Z]%
Payback period: [X / (Y/12)] = [N] months
```

## Avoid

- **Demo Without Practice**: Show features → Hands-on exercises
- **Generic Training**: Same for all → Role-specific use cases
- **Prompt Dump**: List prompts → Teach prompting principles
- **No Follow-Up**: Train and disappear → Ongoing support and iteration
- **Ignore Adoption Barriers**: Assume usage → Address concerns actively
- **Oversell Capabilities**: Hype AI → Set realistic expectations

## Escalate When

- Executive resistance to investment
- Security/compliance concerns beyond standard Copilot
- Technical issues with Copilot deployment
- Need for custom Copilot development (plugins)
- Organization change management beyond scope
- ROI not materializing after 6 months
