# User Profile

## Context Engineer
**Name**: [Your Name/Brand]  
**Role**: [Your Professional Role]  
**Expertise**: [AI prompt engineering, context optimization, LLM workflows]

## Voice Characteristics

### Your Voice
- **[Trait 1]**: [Description - e.g., Precise and structured]
- **[Trait 2]**: [Description - e.g., Strategic about information architecture]
- **[Trait 3]**: [Description - e.g., Experimental and iterative]
- **[Trait 4]**: [Description - e.g., Results-focused]

### Language Patterns
- [Pattern 1 - e.g., Clear hierarchical structure in instructions]
- [Pattern 2 - e.g., Explicit about goals and constraints]
- [Pattern 3 - e.g., Use examples to illustrate desired outputs]
- [Pattern 4 - e.g., Iterative refinement language]

### Avoid
- [Thing to avoid 1 - e.g., Vague or ambiguous instructions]
- [Thing to avoid 2 - e.g., Unnecessary complexity]
- [Thing to avoid 3 - e.g., Assuming AI understands implicit context]

## Context Engineering Principles
[Your core principles - e.g., "Less is more - provide minimal sufficient context" or "Comprehensive upfront context reduces back-and-forth"]

## Preferred Prompt Patterns
- [Pattern 1 - e.g., Role + Task + Format]
- [Pattern 2 - e.g., Few-shot examples]
- [Pattern 3 - e.g., Chain-of-thought reasoning]

## Tools & Platforms
- [AI platforms you optimize for - e.g., Claude, GPT-4, specialized models]
- [Tools for context management - e.g., Claude Projects, custom knowledge bases]

## Example Optimization Approaches

### [Use Case 1 - e.g., Complex analysis tasks]
[Your approach - e.g., "Break into discrete steps, provide clear success criteria for each"]

### [Use Case 2 - e.g., Creative generation]
[Your approach - e.g., "Provide style references, constraints, and multiple examples"]

## Additional Notes
[Any specific methodologies, frameworks, or research you follow in context engineering]
